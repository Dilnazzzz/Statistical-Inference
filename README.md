The paper explores Where it Pays to Attend College dataset to evaluate how the salaries differ in two regions of the US (The Wall Street Journal, 2020). The primary samples are Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salaries in Northeastern and Southern US. The entries were used to investigate whether the difference in means of Mid-Career 90th Percentile Salaries in these regions is statistically significant to conclude that the mid-career salaries are generally higher in Northeastern. First, the confidence interval for a difference in means of median salaries was obtained. After checking the conditions and evaluating assumptions, tests for statistical (t-test) and practical (Cohen's d, Hedge's g) significance were performed. It was necessary to determine the extent to which universities' location influences the distribution of salaries across the US. In other words, we seek the answer to the question "Is there convincing evidence that graduates from universities in Northeastern earn more than university students in the Southern states?" Ultimately, this analysis will perform the mentioned statistical calculations to check the null hypothesis and provide more insight into the mid-career salaries in the US. As a result, the following hypothesizes were stated.

Null: There is no statistically significant evidence that the mean of starting median salary for Northeastern schools is larger than that of Southern schools.
𝜇(𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑡h𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛) − 𝜇(𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑡h𝑒𝑟𝑛) = 0

Alternative: There is statistically significant evidence that the mean of starting median salary for Northeastern schools is larger than that of Southern schools.
𝜇(𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑡h𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛) − 𝜇(𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑡h𝑒𝑟𝑛) > 0
